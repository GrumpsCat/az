      What directory services are available in Azure, and what roles do Microsoft Entra ID
      and Microsoft Entra Domain Services play?
    </strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong> is Azure’s cloud-based identity and access
        management service that manages users, groups, and applications, and supports
        authentication, authorization, and single sign-on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Entra Domain Services</strong> provides managed domain services
        such as domain join, group policy, and LDAP authentication without requiring
        customers to deploy and manage domain controllers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong> is designed for modern cloud applications and
        identity federation, while <strong>Microsoft Entra Domain Services</strong> supports
        legacy applications that rely on traditional Active Directory features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both services help organizations centrally manage identities and control access to
        Azure resources and applications.
      </li>
    </ul>

<section id="authentication-methods">
  <h2>Describe authentication methods</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>
      What authentication methods are available in Azure, including single sign-on (SSO),
      multifactor authentication (MFA), and passwordless authentication?
    </strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying the identity of a user,
        service, or device by requiring credentials to prove who they are.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single sign-on (SSO)</strong> allows users to sign in once and access multiple
        applications and resources using a single identity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multifactor authentication (MFA)</strong> requires two or more forms of
        verification, significantly reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        MFA factors include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Something you know</strong> (password or PIN)</li>
          <li><strong>Something you have</strong> (phone or security key)</li>
          <li><strong>Something you are</strong> (fingerprint or facial scan)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Passwordless authentication</strong> removes passwords and uses stronger
        methods such as biometrics, trusted devices, or cryptographic keys.
      </li>
      <li>
        Azure passwordless options include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows Hello for Business</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Authenticator app</strong></li>
          <li><strong>FIDO2 security keys</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication</strong> is the service that
        enables and manages MFA methods in Azure.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>
      What are external identities in Azure, and how are they used to grant access to users
      outside an organization?
    </strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        An <strong>external identity</strong> is a user, device, or service that exists
        outside an organization’s Azure tenant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Entra External ID</strong> enables secure collaboration with
        external users such as partners, vendors, suppliers, and customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        External users can <strong>bring their own identities</strong>, including corporate,
        government, or social identities (such as Google or Facebook).
      </li>
      <li>
        The external user’s identity provider manages authentication, while access to
        applications and resources is controlled using <strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong>
        or <strong>Azure AD B2C</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        External identity capabilities include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>B2B collaboration</strong> – Allows guest users from other organizations
            to access enterprise applications and resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>B2B direct connect</strong> – Establishes trust between Entra tenants for
            seamless collaboration, such as Teams shared channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Azure AD B2C</strong> – Manages identity and access for consumer-facing
            applications.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Guest access can be governed using <strong>access reviews</strong>, allowing
        organizations to periodically verify whether external users still require access.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Describe Microsoft Entra Conditional Access</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>
      What is Microsoft Entra Conditional Access, and how does it help enforce access
      policies based on identity signals?
    </strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Conditional Access</strong> is a policy-based tool in Microsoft Entra ID that
        controls access to resources based on identity-related signals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identity signals include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who</strong> the user is</li>
          <li><strong>Where</strong> the user is signing in from</li>
          <li><strong>What device</strong> is being used</li>
          <li><strong>Which application</strong> is being accessed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Conditional Access evaluates signals during sign-in and makes a decision to
        <strong>allow access</strong>, <strong>block access</strong>, or
        <strong>require multifactor authentication (MFA)</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It enables <strong>adaptive security</strong>, such as requiring MFA only when a
        sign-in appears risky or comes from an unusual location.
      </li>
      <li>
        Common Conditional Access use cases include:
        <ul>
          <li>Requiring MFA for administrators or remote users</li>
          <li>Restricting access to approved client applications</li>
          <li>Allowing access only from compliant or managed devices</li>
          <li>Blocking access from untrusted or high-risk locations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Conditional Access balances security and productivity by enforcing protection only
        when needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
